\section{Outline}

Our index Lykke Crypto Index 20 (LCI 20) is a weighted average of current market capitalization.

Some Text.\footnote{Code and .tex-files can be found at \href{https://github.com/onnokleen/crypto-index}{https://github.com/onnokleen/crypto-index}}

We focus on weighted average but have maximum weights

\cite{Trimborn2016}

Perfect for ETFs: An equal-quantity portfolio with $q_{i,t} = c$, $c \in \mathbb{R}$, is a one-to-one replication of our LCI (20). Perfect for building ETFs - no rebalancing costs.

\subsection{Definition}

Let $t$ denote time index starting at time $t_0$, $t = t_0, t_1, t_2, \dots$. And let $\mathcal{C}_t$ denote the set of coins that are traded at time $t$.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Price $p_{i,t}$: price of asset $i$ at time $t$
  \item Quantity $q_{i,t}$: overall number of shares/items per asset $i$ at time $t$
  \item Market Capitalization of asset $i$ at time $t$ is $c_{i,t}$
\end{itemize}

$$ \text{LCI20}_t = \frac{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}_{t}} w_{i,t} c_{i,t}}{Divisor} $$

One disadvantage of the real-time re-weighting is that

\subsection{Addressing splits}\label{subseq:split_smoothing}
For anticipated splits/forks we propose an adaptive smoothing technique for addressing ``insane'' price movements in direct aftermath.

\subsection{Calculating LCI 20}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Calculate each coins market share $s_{i,t}$.
  \item Truncate market shares by maximum $\bar s$: $\bar s_{i,t} = \max\{ s_{i,t}, \bar s\}$
  \item Rescale them, so weights sum up to one: $w_{i,t} = \frac{\bar s_{i,t}}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}_t} \bar s_{i,t}}$. Note that $w_{i,t}$ is afterwards greater than $0.25$ due to rescaling.
  \item $$\widetilde{\text{LCI20}}_t = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}_{t}} w_{i,t} c_{i,t}$$
  \item The initial value of the weighted sum is given by $$\widetilde{\text{LCI20}}_{t_0} = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}_{t}} w_{i,t_0} c_{i,t_0}$$
  \item $Divisor = \widetilde{\text{LCI20}}_{t_0} * 100$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Questions to address}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Why 20 currencies? 19-09-2017 14:41 20th market capitalization (STEEM) is only \$286.382.955 and 24 hour trading volume of \$686. Further, the 20 currencies with the highest market capitalization have a share of 92 \% of the total market capitalization and a 24 hour trading volume of 94 \% of the total trading volume of September 22, 2017. If we add another 30 currencies, the 24 hour trading volume increases by 2 percentage points where we think that a smaller but better traceable index outweighs an index with a larger but more volatile currency base.
  \item ``Dead coins'' a problem?
  \item If there is a split (like Bitcoin), new currency is part of Lykke 20 but is part of constituents-check at the end of the week.
  \item Basis: 100 Punkte?
  \item How to get market capitalization of public float?
  \item Maximal weight maybe 20\%? DAX: Maximum weight 10\%.
\end{itemize}

Wikipedia:  In general, the large holdings of founding shareholders, corporate cross-holdings, and government holdings in partially privatized companies are excluded when calculating the size of a public float.

https://www.coindesk.com/rethinking-bitcoin-market-cap/: In 2014, NVIDIA engineer John Ratcliff theorized that approximately 30\% of the current bitcoin supply is made up of ``zombie'' bitcoins that have been inactive for more than a year This number includes bitcoins connected to inaccessible wallets, government-seized bitcoins, ``burned'' bitcoins and bitcoins abandoned during the early days of bitcoins, including Nakamoto's mythical stash of over a million bitcoins.

\subsection{How does it work in other indices}

\begin{itemize}
  \item DAX: Weighting based on market capitalization of public float (bedeutet Streubesitz, keine Aktien von Langzeitanlegern  wie Familie Porsche/Quant).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Features}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \item Constituent changes each week. Maybe Friday? Maybe based on trade volume in last 7 days? Good against ``dead coins''.
\end{itemize}

\section{Example}

Data is from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory}{https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory}

or CoinCap.io via Rest API

Something nice to illustrate:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Volatility in August (Bitcoin-split versus July). Show new composition after split.
\end{itemize}

\section{Splits}

The volatility of the index increases in times shortly before and after a split. For example, the index dropped on August 2, 2017, the day after the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash by $-12.7$ \% which is due to the price drop of Bitcoin ($-5$ \%) and the lower price of Bitcoin Cash (roughly 1/6 of Bitcoin). At this point, investors which held Bitcoin, get the same amount of Bitcoin Cash. However, both currencies share the same transaction history. If one incautiously pushes now a transaction containing only old coins to the wrong transaction chain, one will loese the pushed value in both currencies. Therefore, private investors are usually advised not to trade their old coins or newly gained currency in the days after a split but to wait until it is settled if the new currency becomes accepted.
