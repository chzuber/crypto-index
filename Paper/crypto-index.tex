We propose the Lykke Crypto Index 20 (LCI20) to be a weighted average of the 20 largest cryptocurrencies' market capitalization.\footnote{Code and PDF can be found at \href{https://github.com/onnokleen/crypto-index}{GitHub}.}
The purpose of our index is to closely follow the value of cryptocurrencies in comparison to the US dollar.
We address cryptocurrency-specific challenges as there are, for example, the distinct market behavior around currency splits and the wish to track index evolution in real time.

We proceed as follows:
First, notation and our index calculation are introduced.
Second, we discuss pros and cons of our method.
Third, a reduced-form example of our index on daily data is presented.


\section{Definition}

Let $t$ denote our continuous time index starting at time $t_0$.
Moreover, $\mathcal{C}_t \in \mathbb{N}$ is the set of coins that are tradable at time $t$ across $M \in \mathbb{N}$ relevant market places for crypto-assets.
The price $p_{i,t}$ of asset $i$ at time $t$ is calculated as the mean of the bid-ask spread's midpoint across all $M$ markets.
Quantity $q_{i,t}$ denotes the overall number of currently mined shares/items of asset $i$ at time $t$.
Last, we measure market capitalization $c_{i,t}$ by price times quantity $p_{i,t} \cdot q_{i,t}$.
Note that our definition of market capitalization is just a proxy for the actively traded assts, called the ``public float''.
In stock market indices, only shares that are actively tradable are included in calculating those indices which excludes shares held by strategic long-term investors, e.g.\ founding shareholders or government.
So far, there is neither a systematic and publicly available recording of amounts held by strategic long-term investors nor is the amount of ``dead'' coins known.\footnote{The web is full of reports where people lost their Bitcoins since they saved them on a hard drive which then got broken. Due to the decentralized structure of most of the cryptocurrencies, these coins are lost or ``dead''.}
We therefore weight the index with respect to the total market share and suggest to reconsider weighting it with respect to shares of actively tradable assets when this information is available in the future.


\subsection{Historical development}

Crypto currencies have experienced an upswing in the last months.
Figure~\ref{f:lci20} shows the evolution of our proposed index and Bitcoin's market capitalization share over the last 11 months at a daily data basis.
The data is daily closing prices and market capitalization, both downloaded from \citeauthor{CoinCap} via their Rest API.
It includes up to 32 cryptocurrencies between November 1, 2016 to September 19, 2017.
The cryptocurrencies are from the set of currencies with the largest market capitalization at that specific day.

Our index increases from 100 in November 2016 to 347 in mid of September 2017.
Several new currencies have been introduced/split and gained sizable market capitalization shares.
Bitcoin Cash split from Bitcoin in August 2017 and has a current market capitalization share of 6.5~\%.
Therefore, Bitcoin's market capitalization share decreased from higher than 90~\% in November 2016 to below 50~\% now.
Figure~\ref{f:curshares} depicts the market capitalization shares for the five most important currencies (in terms of market shares today).

\subsection{Six steps to calculate LCI20}

Our index is defined as a standardized ratio of weighted sums relative to its initial value:
\begin{equation}
  \text{LCI20}_t = 100 * \frac{\widetilde{\text{LCI20}}_t}{\widetilde{\text{LCI20}}_{t_0}}
\end{equation}

\noindent To calculate the index, the following six steps are to be taken:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Calculate each coins market share $s_{i,t} = p_{i,t} \cdot q_{i,t}$.
  \item \todo{The currently plotted index is not truncated! We could leave the truncation out by arguing that in the future the dominance of Bitcoins will go down further such that the truncation is not necessary.} Truncate market shares by maximum $\bar s$: $\bar s_{i,t} = \max\{ s_{i,t}, \bar s\}$
  \item Rescale them, so weights sum up to one: $w_{i,t} = \frac{\bar s_{i,t}}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}_t} \bar s_{i,t}}$. %Note that $w_{i,t}$ is afterwards greater than $0.25$ due to rescaling.
  \item Calculate the weighted average $$\widetilde{\text{LCI20}}_t = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}_{t}} w_{i,t} c_{i,t}$$
  \item The initial value of the weighted sum is given by $$\widetilde{\text{LCI20}}_{t_0} = \sum_{i \in \mathcal{C}_{t}} w_{i,t_0} c_{i,t_0}$$
  \item Calculate the index normalized to 100 in $t_0$ over $t$. % $Divisor = \widetilde{\text{LCI20}}_{t_0}$
\end{enumerate}


\section{Discussion}

 Due to the predominance of Bitcoin, one concern could be that the index is redundant if one follows just the Bitcoin price instead of LCI20.
 Figure~\ref{f:lci20vsBTC} shows that both the index and the price of Bitcoins evolve similarly but diverge over time since Bitcoin's share of market capitalization falls.

 \begin{figure}[p]%
     \centering%
     \caption{LCI20 vs.\ Bitcoin price}\label{f:lci20vsBTC}%
     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/lci20_vs_btc_norm.eps}%
     \medskip\newline% Separate caption and notes
     \fnotes{LCI20 and Bitcoin price is normalized to 100 in Nov 1, 2016.}
 \end{figure}

In comparison to \cite{Trimborn2016}, we choose the LCI20 to contain 20 cryptocurrencies once at a time.
They are sorted by market capitalization from high to low and the index will consist always of the first twenty.
This has the advantage that the index represents always the 20th most ``important'' crypto-assets.

We suspect that with intra-day data, the volatility of the index increases in times shortly before and after a split.
For the daily data we use, this is not an issue as it can be seen in Figure~\ref{f:split} for the example of the split of Bitcoin Cash.
The index dropped on August 2, 2017, the day after the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash by $-12.7$ \% which is due to the price drop of Bitcoin ($-5$ \%) and the lower price of Bitcoin Cash (roughly 1/6 of Bitcoin).
At this point, investors which held Bitcoin, get the same amount of Bitcoin Cash.
However, both currencies share the same transaction history.
If one incautiously pushes now a transaction containing only old coins to the wrong transaction chain, one will loese the pushed value in both currencies.
Therefore, private investors are usually advised not to trade their old coins or newly gained currency in the days after a split but to wait until it is settled if the new currency becomes accepted.

\subsection{Addressing splits}\label{subseq:split_smoothing}
For anticipated splits/forks we propose an adaptive smoothing technique for addressing ``insane'' price movements in direct aftermath.
We propose to use one-hour averaged prices for currencies that are anticipated to split when calculating LCI20 beginning one day in advance and ending one day after split





\subsection{Questions to address}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Why 20 currencies? 19-09-2017 14:41 20th market capitalization (STEEM) is only \$286.382.955 and 24 hour trading volume of \$686. Further, the 20 currencies with the highest market capitalization have a share of 92 \% of the total market capitalization and a 24 hour trading volume of 94 \% of the total trading volume of September 22, 2017. If we add another 30 currencies, the 24 hour trading volume increases by 2 percentage points where we think that a smaller but better traceable index outweighs an index with a larger but more volatile currency base.
  \item Done: ``Dead coins'' a problem?
  \item Done: If there is a split (like Bitcoin), new currency is part of Lykke 20 but is part of constituents-check at the end of the week.
  \item Done: Basis: 100 Punkte? - Yes
  \item Done: How to get market capitalization of public float? Wikipedia:  In general, the large holdings of founding shareholders, corporate cross-holdings, and government holdings in partially privatized companies are excluded when calculating the size of a public float. https://www.coindesk.com/rethinking-bitcoin-market-cap/: In 2014, NVIDIA engineer John Ratcliff theorized that approximately 30\% of the current bitcoin supply is made up of ``zombie'' bitcoins that have been inactive for more than a year This number includes bitcoins connected to inaccessible wallets, government-seized bitcoins, ``burned'' bitcoins and bitcoins abandoned during the early days of bitcoins, including Nakamoto's mythical stash of over a million bitcoins.
  \item Maximal weight maybe 20\%? DAX: Maximum weight 10\%.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{How does it work in other indices}

\begin{itemize}
  \item DAX: Weighting based on market capitalization of public float (bedeutet Streubesitz, keine Aktien von Langzeitanlegern  wie Familie Porsche/Quant).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Features}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  \item Constituent changes each week. Maybe Friday? Maybe based on trade volume in last 7 days? Good against ``dead coins''.
\end{itemize}

\end{table*}





Immaturity of market may lead right now to frequent changes of assets included in the lower ranks of our index.
However, we want our definition of the LCI 20 to be ``future-proof'' and expect volatility among ranking of crypto-assets in terms of market capitalization should to decrease in the upcoming two years.
