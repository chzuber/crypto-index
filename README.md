# README to "Lykke Crypto Index 20"

In this project, we propose the crypto-index LCI20 and visualize our index for daily data between November 1, 2016 and September 19, 2017.
The whitepaper is submitted to Lykke Streams' project [Join Lykke in launching a crypto-index investment fund](https://streams.lykke.com/Project/ProjectDetails/join-lykke-in-launching-a-crypto-index).

The project structure is as follows:

- *Data/* contains our daily data sample as well as a data snapshot of all available currencies and their market capitalization from September 22, 2017.
- The file *crypto_index.m* in *Matlab/* calculates the index and produces the paper figures.
- In *Paper/*, our whitepaper can be found.
- The file *crypto-index.r* in *R/* contains the code to download the data via the Rest API and other exercises to construct the index.

The research is conducted by Onno Kleen and Christopher Zuber.
